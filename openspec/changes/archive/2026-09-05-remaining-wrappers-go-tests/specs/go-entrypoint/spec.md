# Delta for go-entrypoint

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A ported command's engine interaction is provable without Docker

For a command listed in `internal/cli/run.go`'s `Run()` switch, the repository SHALL carry a Go
test that verifies what its handler asks of the engine, through a fake substituted for the real
one, requiring no Docker daemon, no network access, and no project beyond what the test itself
builds.
(Previously: covered only `copy-to-container`, `copy-from-container`, `varnish-on`, and
`varnish-off`.)

#### Scenario: Copying into the container

- **GIVEN** a fake engine substituted for the real one
- **WHEN** `copy-to-container <path>` runs against a resolved project
- **THEN** the fake records a call to copy into the container with that path

#### Scenario: Copying everything into the container

- **WHEN** `copy-to-container --all` runs
- **THEN** the fake records the same call with the "everything" flag set

#### Scenario: Copying out of the container

- **WHEN** `copy-from-container <path>` runs
- **THEN** the fake records a call to copy out of the container with that path

#### Scenario: Turning the page cache on

- **WHEN** `varnish-on` runs
- **THEN** the fake records, in order, the VCL edit on the varnish service, a restart of the
  varnish service, and the enable call on the php service

#### Scenario: Turning the page cache off cascades

- **WHEN** `varnish-off` runs
- **THEN** the fake records the VCL edit, the restart, and the disable call, followed by the
  purge and the cache-clean that turning it off leaves behind, in that order

#### Scenario: Clearing generated code

- **WHEN** `purge` runs against a resolved project
- **THEN** the fake records one shell command, run as the web user, that removes exactly the
  generated paths the command lists

#### Scenario: Running the front-end package manager

- **WHEN** `npm <args>` runs
- **THEN** the fake records a call into the container that passes those arguments through
  verbatim to `npm`

#### Scenario: Running n98-magerun

- **WHEN** `n98-magerun <args>` runs
- **THEN** the fake records a call that runs `n98-magerun` with the arguments joined into one
  command, through a shell

#### Scenario: Running the unit suite

- **WHEN** `test-unit <args>` runs
- **THEN** the fake records a call that runs `phpunit` against the unit suite's configuration,
  with the arguments appended
- **AND** when the project defines no bin directory, the fallback bin directory is used

#### Scenario: Running the integration suite

- **WHEN** `test-integration <args>` runs
- **THEN** the fake records a call that changes into the integration suite's own directory, then
  runs `phpunit` against its configuration from the resolved working directory and bin
  directory, with the arguments appended
- **AND** when the project defines no working directory, the fallback working directory is used

#### Scenario: Writing a database dump

- **WHEN** `mysqldump <path>` runs against a resolved project
- **THEN** the fake records a request for a dump at that path from the current directory
- **AND** on success the command answers `{"path": <path>}` in JSON
- **AND** when the fake refuses the request, the command exits with the code reserved for
  engine/Docker failures

### Requirement: A usage error returns before any engine call

`copy-to-container`, `copy-from-container`, and `mysqldump` SHALL validate their arguments before
they ask anything of the engine.
(Previously: covered only `copy-to-container` and `copy-from-container`.)

#### Scenario: No path given

- **WHEN** either `copy-to-container` or `copy-from-container` runs with no path argument
- **THEN** it fails with the missing-path error, and the fake engine used by its test records
  zero calls

#### Scenario: mysqldump with no path

- **WHEN** `mysqldump` runs with no path argument
- **THEN** it fails with the missing-path error, and the fake engine used by its test records
  zero calls

## Note

The `version` scenarios ("Reporting what is installed" and "version with an argument") were part
of this delta until the size gate in tasks.md 1.5 measured 247 changed lines after the first
commit and applied the proposal's cut order; they move, with `version`'s tests and the `Installed`
seam method, to the follow-up change `down-and-set-host-go-tests`.

"The test seam changes nothing a real invocation runs" (unchanged, not modified by this delta)
already covers the four call sites this change routes through `newEngine`: production still
builds the real engine, proven by the same compile-time assertion, `go build ./...`, and the
untouched Bash parity suites.
